#  Update - Now at SUSE Rancher

By Chris Kim (me@chrishkim.com)

If you have any questions feel free to e-mail me at [me@chrishkim.com](mailto:me@chrishkim.com)

## Update

A recent update, I'm now at SUSE Rancher as a Staff Software Engineer working on K3s, RKE2, and their integration into Rancher 2 (what we call provisioningv2)

If you have any questions about these things, don't hesitate to reach out!

I hope to use this blog to talk about nuances/things I find with the integration work for K3s/RKE2 and Rancher 2.
