# Welcome!

Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is just a small blog where I am planning on publishing things I learn as I go along

# Who am I?

I'm currently a Red Hat Consultant based out of the Bay Area in California. I currently specialize in OpenShift Container Platform/Kubernetes/Docker/Containerization on the infrastructure side, but with the constantly changing tides I may find myself specializing in some other Red Hat technology in the future! If you want to get in contact with me, please don't hesitate to e-mail using the contact information found at the bottom of this site.
