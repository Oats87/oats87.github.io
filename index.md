# oats87.github.io

Welcome to my github.io page. I've listed some of the accessible documents below.

So far I've been trying to document how to deploy OpenShift Container Platform on a single VM host on a restricted network, the most recent document (and more thorough one by far is the OCP36_MiniCluster one)

[OCP 3.6 Mini Cluster Notes/Instructions](https://oats87.github.io/OCP36_Mini_Cluster)
[All-In-One OpenShift - outdated](https://oats87.github.io/all-in-one-openshift)

Questions? E-mail me at [chris.kim@redhat.com](mailto:chris.kim@redhat.com) or find me on FreeNode as Oats87
